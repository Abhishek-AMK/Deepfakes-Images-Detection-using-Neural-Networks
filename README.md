# **Deepfakes-Images-Detection-using-Neural-Networks**

**Deepfake technology has advanced rapidly, enabling the creation of highly realistic forged images that can be used for deceptive purposes. The potential misuse of deepfake images poses a significant threat to the integrity of digital media. Therefore, there is a critical need for effective and reliable methods to detect deepfake images.**

**The primary objective of this research is to develop and implement a robust deepfake image detection system using neural network-based analysis. The system aims to accurately distinguish between authentic and manipulated images, contributing to the enhancement of media forensics and trustworthiness in digital content.**

# Significance

**The successful development of an accurate and efficient deepfake image detection system will have broad applications in preserving the authenticity of digital media, combating misinformation, and safeguarding the integrity of visual content on the internet.**

# Scope of the project

**1.Data Collection: Gather a diverse dataset of both authentic and deep fake images to train and validate the neural network model.**

**2.Neural Network Architecture: Design a deep learning architecture suitable for image analysis, with a focus on feature extraction and pattern recognition to identify subtle cues indicative of deep fake manipulation.**

**3.Training and Validation: Train the neural network using the collected dataset, employing techniques such as transfer learning or fine-tuning to improve efficiency and accuracy. Validate the model on separate test datasets.**

**4.Performance Metrics: Define and employ appropriate performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score) to evaluate the effectiveness of the developed deepfake detection model.**

**5.Real-time Application: Explore the feasibility of real-time implementation for on-the-fly detection of deepfake images in various digital platforms.**
